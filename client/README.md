# Weather App

Welcome to the **Weather App**! This app allows you to check the current weather of any city around the world. It displays key weather data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and an icon representing the current weather conditions (sunny, rainy, cloudy, snowy, etc.).

## Features

- Search for the weather in any city.
- View the current temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
- See a weather icon that represents the current condition (sunny, rainy, cloudy, snowy).
- Responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **CSS**: Styling the app with custom styles and media queries for responsiveness.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Fetching weather data based on the city name.

## Example

For example, if you search for "Bishkek", the app will display the following:

- **üå°Ô∏è Temperature**: 43¬∞F
- **üíß Humidity**: 72%
- **üí® Wind Speed**: 5.46 m/s
- **üå¶Ô∏è Condition**: Clouds

## Responsiveness

The app is designed to be responsive, meaning it adjusts to different screen sizes:
- **Desktop**: Standard layout.
- **Tablet**: The layout adapts to make the app easy to view and interact with.
- **Mobile**: On small devices, the app will stack elements to fit the screen properly.
